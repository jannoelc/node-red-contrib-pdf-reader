# node-red-contrib-pdf-reader

![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/node-red-contrib-pdf-reader) ![Node Current](https://img.shields.io/node/v/node-red-contrib-pdf-reader)

A Node-RED node to extract PDF text content. Heavily inspired by https://github.com/RedBackSpider/node-red-contrib-pdfjs

## Differences from the original repository

- Support for read files using file name is removed. Instead, use another node to read a file and pass the contents to this node
- Password support and selecting specific page has been included
- Includes the latest (as of writing) version of https://github.com/mozilla/pdfjs-dist
- Only supports Node 18 and up (due to pdfjs-dist not supporting lower Node versions)
- Partial rewrite and JSDoc-annotated code

### Outputs

`payload`

Results of the parsing will be returned as an array with each element in the array corresponding to a page in the pdf.
Each page in the array is stored as an array of objects which can be seen below. p is the order in the pdf document

```json
[
  {
    "p": 1,
    "x": 328.78, // distance away from the right edge
    "y": 1175.676, // distance away from the bottom of the page
    "t": "Survey Responses 1/02/19 - 31/04/19" // text content
  },
  {
    "p": 2,
    "x": 428.78,
    "y": 1175.676,
    "t": "Survey Responses 1/05/19 - 31/07/19"
  }
]
